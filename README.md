# Ben & Jerry's

A project from when I worked at Ben & Jerry's when I was in 16 and in highschool. The main idea is that there is an iOS app that has the full flavor inventory with allergy and nutritional information. Using that you can create a quick temporary menu for offsite catering events.

The data on the app is managed through a super simple flask webserver that stores and then serves the static files and flavor data.

This is still being actively used by the Ben & Jerry's in Mount Kisco New York.
